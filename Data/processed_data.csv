The goal was to ""disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should review his military strategy without delay.Join us! Veterans USA( @veterans GovSpending"	12000000.0	0.11599999999999999	0.13699999999999998	0.747	-0.6252	negative	0.626

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable? We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over. Let's wait and keep our eyes open. Black Lives Matter!		0.035	0.142	0.823	-0.9711	negative	12.217

I can't breathe."" On Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall, Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a flashlight before killing him in view of his family members. Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a flashlight, Sander's attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate. Parrish later clarified that those allegations came from family members who witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced ""some kind of asphyxiation"" during the altercation. Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two children. The last words of Eric garner were ""I can't breathe,"" the last words of Jonathan Sanders were ""I can't breathe, let me go"".

Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that he experienced in school and on the streets. People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested. What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police, improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer. That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed people of color killed by police.

That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that plague black women every day. ""Black features are beautiful, black women are not,"" Stenberg wrote. ""White women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty standards."" Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank Garmback, to face charges in the shooting. Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun. Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots pellets, died the next day. By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

Police encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen pistol. His mother said that she respected the police and that her son ""shouldn't have had the gun."" But from what witnesses have told her, she said, ""They didn't have to shoot him down like that."" One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at anyone as he tried to run from officers. When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun)- he'll be immediately shot by the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then here we go.

Hodges refused to leave his house after he was not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher. A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher. Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was evicted from his house? How come homelessness and unemployment among American veterans is much higher today than for the general population of the United States of America?		0.111	0.076	0.812	0.8363	positive	35.714

Teen is paralyzed. Last Saturday the 16-year-old Brandon Claxton prompted an officer to shoot him three times in a housing complex in Hodiamont Avenue. According to police, they responded to a call about someone with a stolen 40-caliber pistol. Brandon Claxton is in critical conditions. But according to witnesses, Brandon did not point a pistol at anyone but he was trying to run away from the officers. Where is the video evidence of police shooting? Police Chief Sam Dotson said that there is not a clear view on video. What if police is trying to cover up the story? Did you know that police did not allow Brandon's mother to see her son because he was in custody? Do you believe that police was justified to arrest Brandon? Cameras don't lie!

Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice. America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping the very rich from ever being brought to justice.		0.10800000000000001	0.124	0.767	-0.6618	negative	7.644

The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.

Due to her bad health history she was taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to help. According to American legislation, the courthouse officials are supposed to check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one checked Tumer's cell for more than two hours. A total of five African-American women have been found dead in police custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor charges and still their deaths are under investigation. Sandra Bland from Texas, Kindra Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell after being arrested by police officers.

Being one of the 17 children of former slaves she was the first and the only child to go to African-American school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In addition; Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For instance; she was the president of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Colored Women. Moreover. in 1935 Mary Bethune became an advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started her civil rights organization. the National Council of Negro Women. The great educator and civil right activist Mary McLeod Bethune demonstrated the values of education. the philosophy of love and the wise use of power.

A Maryland town several weeks ago fired its first black Police Chief, now exposing a racial rift The leaders of small Maryland's city in Eastern Shore fired the Pocomoke City's first black police Chief Kelvin Sewell due to his incompetence and refusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less than his white predecessors. This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are treated unfairly.

However, there is more work to be done to solve racial tensions in America. The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside connections with the government. People attempt to stop racism the government usually assumes to be problematic but protesters force the government to find compromise.

Just over a week before his death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter. Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 a.m. on Friday, hearing reports that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom, Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said. And now there are three main points that you should think of: 1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo State University. Never was involved in criminal activities. 2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and was working under the supervision of a training officer. 3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

How should we talk to our children about how safely interact with police officers in order to protect themselves? Tina Carter-Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive. The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled over? What if they do something they don't supposed to be doing? It is not always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it's a reality. What if police officers will automatically assume that your child is criminal because of how him or her looks. Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the way they look. That's why it's important to instruct our children how to react when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows your child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store. Remember, anything is better than dying.

St. Louis police fatally shot a black teenager while trying to issue search warrant On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri city after St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the suspect four times were about seven years on the force. That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the city and the government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in America instead of suspecting every single black men? We cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America, than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You choose.

What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell. who had a severe mental illness had been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a zebra cake. a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth; Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge. A judge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health crisis. Yes; you can die over 5 dollars here in America. Nothing new here. Justice is just an empty word in this country.

The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses. Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left unconscious. Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong. Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility. Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything else, including that of the citizens they allegedly ""protect and serve."""		0.095	0.11	0.794	-0.0538	neutral	11.88

Had the situation been reversed, however, police officers would face neither criminal nor civil prosecution for declining to aid a citizen under assault by a suspect. A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident, allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to intervene. Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid ""was reasonable under the circumstances,"" but the burden of demonstrating that this is the case is placed upon the accused.

They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression. Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon you have against police abuse and brutality. The most famous civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of African- Americans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa Parks changed our lives forever. But what changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater equality?

She was shot by the cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped in January 2015. Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family. We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much attention as possible to the lack of justice for the families of those who lost their beloved ones at the hands of the police. Invite everyone you know and join us on May 21.

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march.

The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait.

His revolutionary knowledge mixed with street experience made him powerful unstoppable force that spoke to the hearts of millions of people. His songs touch on a number of engaging topics, including religion, women, oppression, etc. 2Pac was a humanitarian, who stood up for those who couldn't stand up for themselves. He believed in Fight and Speaking the Truth. Nowadays a lot of singers, both black and white use their music to sell records, just for making money. American society at all levels became too corruptive, starting from our government and ending with ordinary citizens. On the contrary Tupac did his music to influence the world. That's why he spoke to issues of poverty, oppression and racism. Today young African-Americans have fallen under bad influence of money, drugs and so on. Yeah, it is all started from the government's attitude towards Blacks. But let's remember Tupac and his ability to question the social order. Changes, one of his popular songs, asks everyone to change their lifestyles for better society. He always asked people to share with each other and to learn to love each other.		0.142	0.09699999999999999	0.76	0.8864	positive	4.372

A young man from Georgia was shot to death at a pool party at Fayette. It was an advertised on social 200 teenager's pool party which ended up with shootings of unknown assailant for unknown reasons. One of the five injured, a 19-year-old black teenager Clanton passed away on the way to hospital. In fact, the media has not made a transparent effort to cover up the incident. Why the pool party in Georgia is a silent story? Why the police was not aware of a large party? Why this story has no national outrage? Is it ok when a black teenager dies? Unfortunately, the responding police officers were not able to prevent the tragedy. From these facts one might conclude, police officers know the easiest ways to arrest people, but they are irresponsible to avoid the shootings at the average pool party.		0.10300000000000001	0.159	0.738	-0.8748	negative	3.083

The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore? #CharlestonShooting #chsnews		0.054000000000000006	0.252	0.6940000000000001	-0.9962	negative	5.402

The McKinney Police Department, Chief Of Police Greg Conley said that Casebolt's decision to leave was voluntary and that he would continue to collect a pension and benefits. Why are the police so aggressive? It's in every state around the country. The young girl at the pool party was treated horrible. Our society needs police, good police, people who will solve crimes but, unfortunately, today we need someone who will protect us from the police. At the same time, it is good that millions of regular people got a glimpse of what kind of policing minorities have endured for decades.		0.11900000000000001	0.07400000000000001	0.807	0.7745	positive	2.147

Well, then how come Detroit is no less dangerous then (the city ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous cities)?? When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his rearview mirror he chose to proceed with caution since some people are known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a well-lit area to pull over in. As a result, he was charged with 'fleeing' police. People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to communicate with officers only in the well-lit areas. And get charged for that. Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military operations in the foreign countries, our country's at war with its own citizens with the help of police.		0.037000000000000005	0.161	0.802	-0.9677	negative	12.894

West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy."" ""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told?'No, he can't deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie."" West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The number is horrific."		0.054000000000000006	0.175	0.772	-0.985	negative	0.0

The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so. It's hard to believe. Do they think we're idiots or something? Cops imprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you to war, keep you poor, call you a thug and get away with it.

Amari Brown, a 7-year-old boy on the city's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities. Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 p.m Saturday and 4:45 a.m. Sunday. Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing, hitting both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest. No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in. How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body? He just played with his friends outdoor. Is human life really worth nothing in our country? Rest in peace, Amari Brown.		0.096	0.175	0.7290000000000001	-0.965	negative	9.338

As a child, Newton experienced racial discrimination that influenced him to create the Black Panther Party as a voice of black people. His party grew up to a size of 5,000 full time party workers in 45 branches across America and inspired generation in North America to join the struggle against oppression.

The criminal justice system is very important institution where law enforcement investigate a crime gathering evidences to identify the presumed perpetrator ensuring that rights of the convicted are respected. But what if American criminal justice reform outdated and the country need to focus on a renewed sense of justice? What if disproportionate punishment is the main challenge of the criminal justice system? Disproportionate punishments known far and wide across the United States of America. Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots, then they must think about the living standards of black population that is several times below the living standards of white people in America. In addition, the White House must reduce the unemployment rates of black population by revising the hiring policy for black Americans.Therefore, if we want a life's balance, the government have to reconsider all these things, because Black Americans lives matter.		0.129	0.191	0.68	-0.9755	negative	8.202

The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country? What if the church is not a safe place anymore?		0.055999999999999994	0.261	0.6829999999999999	-0.9962	negative	0.0

And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.		0.10800000000000001	0.055999999999999994	0.836	0.9432	positive	14.782

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America!

The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened. We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism, law enforcement system and so on.

The lion's share of these visas are for lesser-skilled and lower-paid workers and their dependents who, because they are here on work-authorized visas, are added directly to the same labor pool occupied by current unemployed jobseekers. Expressly because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly substitute these workers for Americans. Improved border security would have no effect on the continued arrival of these foreign workers, refugees, and permanent immigrants—because they are all invited here by the federal government.

A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe.		0.055	0.13	0.815	-0.9721	negative	11.623

And we know why every Americans have the right to bear arms. First, the 2nd amendment makes people less prone to crimes. Most of people will not attack others, if they have a chance to be shot. Moreover, armed citizens help to prevent some crimes. Second, the 2nd amendment gives equal odds for criminals and people who have no negative intentions. They both have firearms. Third, gun owners as usual feel a responsibility, it makes them law-abiding citizens. Of course, every rule has an exception.

Most problems we face happen because we've stopped calling things by their names and the assassination of cops in Dallas was no exception. We're hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't want to `offend' someone. And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially — the sooner this war on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be attacked by a hateful gang.

Direct U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973. The government spent more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation. Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the war and its supporters. In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C. There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during the war are inscribes. Latter the total additions brought to 58,267.		0.035	0.215	0.75	-0.9774	negative	15.553

The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million. Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here. It's the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous problems for the nation.		0.13	0.16699999999999998	0.703	-0.9468	negative	10.135

Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed.

Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions.

It's not just the right to bear arms. It's respect to American history. The Founding Fathers were very smart people. And it may be assumed they were smarter than many liberals. The second amendment is deterrent. If a criminal knows you have a gun, he doesn't want to rob you. Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate. The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in wrong places.

Moreover, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Hosseini Khamenei is too disrespectful to the United States despite of friendly actions of Obama's administration. And Iranian military command claims that Iran is ready to come into collision with America at any moment. The Iran deal is a shame of the United States. Senate Republicans were right when they expressed their distrust of Iranian government. It's not clear why Obama has refused containment of Iran that is an potential enemy not only for the United States, but also for the rest world. Barack Obama is, by all appearances, a true traitor of the United States. And it's not empty words — the rapprochement with Iran is either a treachery or stupidness.		0.096	0.11	0.794	0.0469	neutral	14.506

Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won't tend to radical activities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans.		0.087	0.18600000000000003	0.727	-0.9781	negative	12.087

President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah.

It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier. The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't matter. The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general. It's pity when some politicians think otherwise. People should understand that a gun is not a killing tool, it's self-defense tool.

They began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings. Much of the personnel data had been stored in the lightly protected systems of the Department of the Interior, because it had cheap, available space for digital data storage. The administration is urgently working to determine what other agencies are storing similarly sensitive information with weak protections. Officials would not identify their top concerns, but an audit issued early last year, before the Chinese attacks, harshly criticized lax security at the Internal Revenue Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Energy Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission — and the Department of Homeland Security, which has responsibility for securing the nation's critical networks.

I think immigrants should prove that they are deserved to stay in the United States. Why should we give a citizenship to those who cannot give something good for the nation? The worst thing is that illegal immigrants who broke the law to live in the United States demand ask for indulgences. What nonsense! Illegals should be deported from the country invariably. But Obama's administration is tied to the chariot of immigrants. Democrats know that immigrants will vote for the Democratic party. Especially former illegals. That's why Barack Obama tries to give the Immigration Amnesty to illegals as soon as possible. It will allow to increase a number of votes for a Democratic Party presidential candidate in 2016. And democrats don't care about the fact that most of immigrants will become welfare recipients, increasing unemployment rate. America doesn't need immigrants, democrats do. What's more important: to win Presidential elections in 2016 or to make America better? Democrats seem to choose first option.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of Amber's family and friends whom she clearly loved deeply. Trans woman murdered in Detroit. According to initial police reports, 20-year- old Amber Monroe was shot to death. A lot of transgendered women don't have support systems or employment. So they are forced to do whatever they can do to survive. This attack was fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th murder of a transgender woman of color. Transgender women, and especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by violence. Her life was just beginning... I know that this loss will leave so many people with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers. Let's work for real change so that our transgender sisters can be free from persecution. I know we can do better. We have to do better!		0.11199999999999999	0.21	0.6779999999999999	-0.9724	negative	12.846

One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky. There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth. Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against injustice and inequality! #Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination		0.085	0.073	0.8420000000000001	0.2112	neutral	8.539

The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo. with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the American version of Je suis Charlie?

The ceremony will mark the official reopening of the U.S. embassy along Havana's oceanfront promenade that overlooks the Florida Straits. `My inspiration is thinking about 90 miles separating the two countries and the two people, 90 miles is the sea between us.' Just 90 miles, but at the same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba. The poet added he hopes there's still possible to achieve ""healing"" between the two countries. `This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so surreal still... This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new things to come.' It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba, country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of these conflicts... And there's more - severe economic crisis, socialist dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

In Oregon,judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to serve a same-sex couple. In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' ""free speech"" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public!

A Kentucky clerk who defied a federal judge's order to issue marriage licenses and turned away four gay couples has until Monday to convince the judge to delay his mandate. U.S. District Judge David L. Bunning rejected Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' claim that her Christian faith should exempt her from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples and ordered her on Wednesday to hand out the licenses. But her office kept denying them. Interesting what would happen if I walked up to my boss and said I refuse to the job I am being paid for today? Let me think... guess I would stand in the unemployment line! Her job is not to participate in gay weddings!! All she has to do is confirm that the paperwork is correct!

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by suicide on August 11 2014. His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: ""As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions."" Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: ""I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern."" When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro- LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital —one of Williams' favourite charities. Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people's lives, and giving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you.

I'm gay."" For many parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?""). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!

It's estimated that over 134000 American veterans are transgender. Not long ago these people were forced into hiding. As a result, many were unable treatments for their gender dysphoria, a state of emotional distress caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with their gender identity. Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong friends, your job, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless they have to do so. Transphobic slur of stupid politicians like GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee seeking to tremendous efforts of transgender community who are still struggle for equal rights. We know how easily bigots and fools who has power are able to reverse progressive changes for their own benefit. We can't let that happen!

Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians, especially those who support marriage equality.

Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service. Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban. Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded! America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity. Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war. #Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega		0.135	0.083	0.782	0.9391	positive	14.172

Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is the biggest mistake! When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and harassment. Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed!

Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets. That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states — so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it! There's a part of me that feels very sad for NOM's fanatics. When they finally kick the bucket, they'll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly face it or not) that their Life's Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they worked for made anyone's life better. At all. They didn't win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.

Police said that Mercedes and Josh knew each other, but it is not clear if Vallum knew Williamson was a transgender. Jeanie Miller, whom Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was transgender. Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in 1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people.

Reports indicate that he has just put forth a $1.3 billion budget proposal, to be distributed among 75,000 minors that are expected to cross into the United States this year from Central America. That breaks down to about $17,613 a child—an amount that is significantly higher than what the government gives to Social Security Retirees. According to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the average annual SSA retirement benefit for legal citizens is roughly $14,772. As if that weren't enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for refugees. This just says it all. Again and again he ignores the needs of American citizens, but has no problem taking their hard earned money just give it to people who deserve it the least. I guess Veterans don't need a better social security. Thank you Obama for betraying America.	33000000.0	0.083	0.12300000000000001	0.795	-0.8131	negative	18.182

Thanks to Obama's and Hillary's policy, illegals come here because they wait for amnesty promised. The wrong course had been chosen by the American government; but all those politicians are too far from the border to see who actually sneaks through it illegally. Rapists, drug dealers, human traffickers; and others. The percent of innocent poor families searching for a better life is too small to become an argument for amnesty and Texas warm welcome.	6400000.0	0.139	0.184	0.677	-0.765	negative	24.04

Secondly, Hillary refused to apologize to all veterans, when she has made several remarks about veterans ""embellishing"" the situation at the VA. Finally, Hillary is the only one politician (except Barack Obama) who is despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans.

If you think it was just a coincidence, you make a mistake. Johnson got set up in one building and moved more than 10 miles away to another building owned by the same people to shoot from. It doesn't look like it is a coincidence. Moreover, some witnesses said that they saw Jonson visiting a mosque. Muslims seem to be not peace-loving as they say.

Lee Elementary school has a new name: Russell Lee. The Austin School Board voted 8-1 to change the name Monday night.The school board had three name options from which to choose: Russell Lee, a photographer from the school's neighborhood who started UT's photography program. The board approved Russell Lee at the request of the school's Campus Advisory Council. So, what can I say? This is a disgrace for the Texas authorities! I am shocked at the dismantling of southern history. We know that our ancestors fought for our freedom. These names were, are and always will be the part of Texas history. Why is Texas administration willing to do anything what feds say them? Isn't it obvious that the Federal government aims to destroy our history? This is a madness! Therefore, I need to ask you: are you ready to defend our Heritage? The Southern history needs protection now more than ever before!	6400000.0	0.057	0.096	0.847	-0.7605	negative	18.833

After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas. ""We're not going into Syria"", Trump said it to calm down those who got really concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war. Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first.

Our military presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly opposite to the ""America First"" concept. I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential campaign Trump said ""let's bring back our soldiers home"", and now it's really time to do it. This is not our war."		0.08199999999999999	0.099	0.8190000000000001	-0.10300000000000001	neutral	12.69

We could have solved thousands of economic and security problems by simply rejecting the aggressive military policy we've been having for so long. Iraq war didn't end terrorism, and didn't solve the Islamization problem. If we repeat the same war in Syria, we'll only get the same result: no profit for American citizens and several thousands of dead American soldiers. Globalists, terrorists and Corporations are the only ones who benefit from oil wars.		0.11199999999999999	0.321	0.5670000000000001	-0.978	negative	9.839

We've been watching our military commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it will end now when Trump is in charge. A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa. We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all. Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly another oil war. We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition, the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone. There's only one chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe.		0.095	0.134	0.7709999999999999	-0.8745	negative	9.68

Jermaine Walker was arrested and sent to prison after the police officers and a state's attorney investigator had LIED UNDER OATH. They said that there was no surveillance camera in the alley where they arrested him ; even though it was and Walker said that! It's another prove that if you are black in this country; you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison literally for the color of your skin. Walker's attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?!

Carter said he was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma, Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them. Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks. Very ridiculous.

Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers — ages of 5, 9, and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a fined of $15, 863.		0.053	0.11599999999999999	0.8320000000000001	-0.8779	negative	10.102

Another arrest was carried out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there. Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

At the request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days. 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to empower and advance Black community.

This is how it looks like when A White Police kills a black Civiliian, and also feels it's his right to sue the dead because sympathizers gave him a sleepless night. If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity.

This is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired. It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough,""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

President Obama was elected for a reason. He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great. The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In no time; ""White Power' will be stronger than before.

It started in North Carolina but it can spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights. The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same —day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill, which aimed to ""modernize"" two references to ""Orientals"" and ""Negros"" in the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with ""Asian Americans"" and ""African Americans,"" respectively. ""The term `Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good,"" Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

Can you believe these numbers? Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the whole community. Kids have to grow up not knowing their fathers and not having the support they need to make rights choices and school-to-prison pipeline doesn't leave them much of a choice. The kids grow up in extreme poverty without the access to the basic things like healthcare or education. The system is build to keep as many black people in the jails as possible. Being black in the US means being in a constant danger! You never know when you will be killed or sent to prison, because of the color of your skin.

In some state, the numbers are even more disturbing. For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school. The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline exists. Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education is only their privilege.		0.051	0.15	0.799	-0.8999	negative	9.422

This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

In 1970, Rice was one of the two officers who were charged for the murder of Omaha police officer, Larry Minard. Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him. He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska. Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown.

This is a racial act. Report says between hits; they screamed; `White power!' before Dedmon ran him over. causing fatal injuries. There is no particular reason for whatever they did so America shouldn't think they have done something much greater. `Money cannot buy life,' that is what Bob Nesta Marley said and he is absolutely right.		0.054000000000000006	0.2	0.747	-0.9645	negative	0.0

After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a ""behavior specialist"" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young student was fired. The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who abuse any child.

And why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what? Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP demanded that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte.

TWO GEORGIA POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN FIRED AFTER VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college student during a traffic stop. According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice?

Why there are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national average? She wasn't for us here before the elections, remember?

According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay."	24000000.0	0.043	0.207	0.75	-0.9942	negative	18.339

But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating to the Black Youth Project 100. Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward ""Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to Build Black Futures"" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States of America. ""I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those communities,"" he said. When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care about haters.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, ""It's Up to Us,"" she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives. Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half of people shot by cops are mentally ill? Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals."	24000000.0	0.03	0.172	0.797	-0.9789	negative	10.426

However, most of these athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10, after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day, the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season and canceled the whole football season.

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide. Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have different hair texture.	24000000.0	0.035	0.18899999999999997	0.7759999999999999	-0.9463	negative	56.25

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever since they returned to work; they have been subjected to petty attacks and denied attempts in promotion. Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper Hall received a ""need improvement rating,"" his squad car was taken away, and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall,. police trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended on the basis of race. Once again the race car is alive and well.

According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building. Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should not be tolerated.

For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation proceeds.

Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed. We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in police custody."		0.047	0.135	0.818	-0.9728	negative	11.111

Hundreds of unarmed black men and women died at the hands of police officers. We are tired to feel neglected and ignored. We all have had enough. And now we need to come together, be honest and get the government's attention. We do not expect you to solve generations of inequality and oppression overnight. We do, however, expect you to come and to address the issues and put forward a plan to make change. #StopNativeGenocide #BlackLivesMatter		0.037000000000000005	0.175	0.789	-0.9652	negative	0.0

Bombing random targets and going for momentary aims, taking reckless decisions and shifting our focus off crushing terrorists only leads to more casualties among civilians and creates even more suffering.

Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other groups. These people want more American involvement because it means more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what's truly important and we will end the war in Syria sooner than you can imagine.		0.171	0.11900000000000001	0.71	0.8019	positive	9.867

That explains why the Democrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy America just to be elected. We have to defend this nation!

If you think that Muslims ignore some Islamic rules, you're wrong. For example, a Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for leaving Islam. What would you do if your wife or husband converts to Islam? Probably you would be upset. In the worst case, you would sue for divorce. But I'm sure you would not kill your spouse. That's the difference between our cultures.		0.051	0.237	0.7120000000000001	-0.9893	negative	16.085

In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees — ""not even orphans under the age of five"". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to ""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez, brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi- Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held personally and financially responsible for their actions. Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another attitude to people in blue?		0.078	0.218	0.7040000000000001	-0.9837	negative	16.348

Please, join families of people killed by law enforcement at the National Day of Protest Against Police Brutality on October 22. 956 people were killed by police in 2015, and at least 161 of them were unarmed. We all witness justice being gone from this country, and we all understand: each of these stolen lives must never be forgotten. October 22 is a day when thousands of people throughout the country can join forces to express their outrage, sorrow and resistance as a response to the brutality of this system.

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now.

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one.		0.018000000000000002	0.28300000000000003	0.6990000000000001	-0.9931	negative	0.0

Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking. Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless. The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it.

A man was arrested for SMOKING A CIGARETTE OUTDOORS! I bet the news related to 'hard to believe in' but still... Watching the video I've only noticed people peacefully enjoying the beautiful nature on a bright sunny day, and as soon as police show up the police ruined the camping. I wonder what would happen; if people stood together against the police? Is it any chance to transform police brutality into something peaceful?

Cooke didn't commit any crime, that's why she wanted to leave, but officers had the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and the female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg before she could go home.

Instead of getting fired or arrested for her actions, she is facing only a disciplinary review. The victim's only crime was filming him while she was assaulting and brutalizing his neighbors! Though it's legal to film the police, cops are so scared of people recording them. It means that we have to keep following them with our cameras.

The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran trooper, took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near Houston. Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was already surrendering off his motorcycle.

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law, it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it. In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you, they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job. Bad that America trained not like this!???"		0.113	0.086	0.8009999999999999	0.6991	positive	11.354

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this country,"" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?"" The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!"""		0.063	0.157	0.779	-0.9783	negative	15.263

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign, but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States.

The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be filled. In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed. He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was accused of committing a felony. Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!		0.138	0.086	0.7759999999999999	0.9188	positive	14.246

News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices	It was a powerful moment in an America that has seen hate crimes against Muslim Americans triple since November. In an America where the Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite 78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9 March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in pigs blood. So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House.		0.10800000000000001	0.1	0.792	-0.1566	neutral	0.0

Let's continue to preserve our history from substitution. It is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist. Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance. Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the ""racist"" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until 1864 regardless of his skin color.

In the 1730s, a seven-year-old English girl was washed up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people are the best of the best and I'm proud to be Black! #Blackprideus #black #blacklove #african #africanamerican #blacklivesmatter #icantbreathe #blackpride #blackandproud black priiide Yoyoyoyoyoy	1900.0	0.19699999999999998	0.0	0.8029999999999999	0.9802	positive	0.252

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth, eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5 million in cash, according to a press release. ""It would be safe to say that the money would be taken back to Mexico, and that's where the source of the cocaine was,"" special agent Tim Stone said. This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as they can. At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.

A routine revenue collection stop turned into a nightmare for this black man. Kevin Campbell was driving his wife's minivan home in June when he was targeted for revenue collection by Allen Park Police Officer Daniel Mack.

The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.		0.11800000000000001	0.14400000000000002	0.738	-0.6584	negative	12.545

To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on.

Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking!		0.235	0.111	0.654	0.9572	positive	10.922

Now Serena has 23 major singles titles. She's about to make a new world record but she's already made history. Serena is still the best tennis player at her 35. Serena and Venus made tennis black. Never before the world had a chance to admire black excellence on the tennis court. Despite the stupid mockeries aimed at their race and appearance, the Williams sisters are still the best, full of love and perfection! Thank you sisters!

Since that moment Ebony's mother called her ""Dr. Hilton"". It wasn't easy to follow the dream for Ebony. Or it's better to say that there were some hardships — for example, Ebony was growing without a father etc, but despite these things she successfully got the proper education and became the first black female anesthesiologist in 2013. Hilton says she never had plan B. Now she is mentoring youth as a member of program called Girls Loving OurSelves Successfully (GLOSS). That's sweet. Black women always show the power in any conditions. That's inspiring!

As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap	12000000.0	0.249	0.044000000000000004	0.7070000000000001	0.9987	positive	10.771

People should pay more attention to education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird. White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.

The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support."" Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people."" The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African- Americans.

That's why the US often offers Mexicans to join the armed forces, in exchange for what they promise to give American citizenship. In this regard, Mexicans are often sent to the war zone in Syria or other countries, from where they sometimes do not return. Many Mexicans have to go for it, as today the process of obtaining American citizenship can last for years and even dozens of years. The US policy towards Mexicans is becoming increasingly brutal, therefore, it is necessary to stop any attempts by the US government to send Mexicans to the war zones, where they fight for any unknown goals.	49000000.0	0.033	0.149	0.8170000000000001	-0.9501	negative	13.349

His name is Miguel Perez and he is Chicano in every sense of the word. Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8-years- old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the U.S. Army and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen, Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and began the deportation process. This system doesn't appreciate our sacrifices. America was designed that way it will only benefit gringos. Miguel Perez is a real hero, who was betrayed by America.

My father was not there to see me walk and receive my diploma. That day he was working like every other day of the week. He works in agricultural farming, I am a Latina, my parents are Latinos working for the American dream. I had to go to him so he can see all his hard work paying off. Giving him my proof of what he has taught me. Your words don't have nothing against his sweat. Repost	49000000.0	0.076	0.016	0.9079999999999999	0.6705	positive	18.509

During elementary, middle school and high school, I fought every obstacle that was thrown my way. When I got to high school I began to take AP classes which led me to create a goal to continue onto higher education. Formal education allowed me to begin a career but most importantly it allowed me to figure out a special side of me. I am so blessed and humbled to be first-generation, undocumented, brown, and a product of the hard work of a single mother. Repost	49000000.0	0.15	0.048	0.802	0.9257	positive	15.664

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief. It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale. Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda influences even on Southern people. The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect. It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect our history and fight against liberal brainwashing.	22000.0	0.131	0.231	0.638	-0.9491	negative	15.254

If you exclusively date outside of your ethnicity and culture, you hate yourself. Don't talk to me until you start to love yourself. I'm going to get many people complaining about this post... I don't care. If you won't check for your own people, seek help not more approval. I'm not saying you should ever check for people outside of your culture, I am saying brothers if every women you have ever been with, isn't from your culture/ethnic group, you have issues of the mind. You are doing this not by love but on purpose, because you hate yourself subconsciously, it's ok, just love yourself and heal your illness. ? #westandtogether #melanin #blackisbeautiful #blacklivesmatter #blackgirlmagic #USA #blackandproud #Africanamerican #unite4justice #melanin #icantbreathe #hood #blackgirl #blackbeauty #darkskin #blackqueen #blackqueens #problack #afro #afrocentric #boycott #november8 #elections2016 #ripaltonsterling #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher	2900000.0	0.098	0.102	0.8	0.2246	neutral	0.0

On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light. The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll down her window ""all the way"" to receive her ticket. When King refused, which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her, the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground. When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change.

He said that sending troops to Syria was a very difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing innocent people that for starting a useless war. Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed. Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill innocent kids in Syria.

Why do you think that Santa is white? Nobody knows the color of his skin, nobody has ever seen him, but white supremacists go crazy if they see a black Santa. That's always making me laugh.

On April 14 the Plummers' door had been kicked in by burglars. On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see the police lights because the unit was parked down the road. Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection. When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend off the would-be burglars. However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

In the sense that efforts were really made to prevent Black people from participating in such sports, back in the days. But thanks to Debi Thomas and other Black skaters; we changed the game and on Feb. 8. 1986. Debi became the first Black skater to hold a US national titles in ladies' single figure scating. Debi; a physician, became the 1986 World champion, the 1988 Olympic bronze medalist; and a two-time U.S. national champion. #PanAfricanism #BlackNationalism #BlackEmpowerment #African Empowerment #AfricanAndProud #BlackAndProud #BlackPride #BlackPower #BlackLivesMatter #Amerikkka #UnapologeticallyBlack #UnapologeticallyAfrican #BlacklnAmerica #BlacklsBeautiful #KnowThySelf #KnowledgeOfSelf #KnowledgeOfSelflsANationaIity #EconomicEmpowerment MntegrationFailed #WhiteLiesMatter #Education #African Unification #AfricanUnity #BlackLove #JusticeOrElse #ProBlack #Regrann #blackexcellence #goals	2900000.0	0.136	0.0	0.8640000000000001	0.9583	positive	18.945

Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice"	2900000.0	0.034	0.09699999999999999	0.8690000000000001	-0.9638	negative	11.761

Your vote should be precious to y'all cus its your power to put another person in authority over you, your freedom, your daily life and your safety. To most people, it's about just going out to vote, if you did just that because you want to, well done, if you didn't, aka #BOYCOTT just like me, you also got your reasons. BUT, let those reasons be genuine! Let them be your reasons, not influenced upon or manipulated in any way. I'm proud of this mama not because she didn't vote #Hillary or #Trump, but simply because she did her research, decided for herself, in her interest and the interest of her kids, and voted consciously! I'm glad i choose not to be a part of this whole system. Im proud to be woke	17000000.0	0.20199999999999999	0.021	0.777	0.9797	positive	11.674

Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we expect others to support our amazing businesses?

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most. The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it cant be torn down! I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement!

Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal profession and went to law school right after his parole. He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards, Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well. —ListVerse-r	330000.0	0.201	0.068	0.73	0.9403	positive	6.369

As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices.	330000.0	0.14300000000000002	0.048	0.809	0.9485	positive	18.143
