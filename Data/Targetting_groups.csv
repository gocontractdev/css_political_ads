596,LGBT community or Same-sex marriage,41,331,"THE US ARMY HAS PUNISHED CHELSEA MANNING for possessing books and magazines having to do with LGBTQ and political issues. They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted system is against her. It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must be ""broken"" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and second, because she's trans. Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character. But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych ward? Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had been through enough already!

And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman's touch:-) Isn't it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written and illustrated by Jason Badower. Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story - specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide. ""I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to step forward and officially endorse this new law,"" he said. ""I thought, let's not just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it."" Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark milestone in LBGTQ rights history. Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-) #wonderwoman #superheroes #marriageequality #gaymarriage #lesbian",LGBT

Just 90 miles, but at the same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba. The poet added he hopes there's still possible to achieve ""healing"" between the two countries. `This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so surreal still... This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new things to come.' It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba, country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of these conflicts... And there's more - severe economic crisis, socialist dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: ""As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions."" Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: ""I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern."" When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro- LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital —one of Williams' favourite charities.

After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a ""behavior specialist"" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young student was fired. The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.",Black

According to a police report; 21-year-old Demetrius Hollins was pulled over near Lawrenceville for changing lines several times without signaling. When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions.

According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.",Black

When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017.

As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois It's not the full letter, but some extracts.
