Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board â€” or replace them. There is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time."" Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and why the hell are we still in Afghanistan?

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left unconscious. Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong. Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

For many parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?""). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation.
